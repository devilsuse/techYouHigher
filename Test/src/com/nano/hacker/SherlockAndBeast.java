/**
 * Sherlock Holmes is getting paranoid about Professor Moriarty, his archenemy.
 * All his efforts to subdue Moriarty have been in vain. These days Sherlock is
 * working on a problem with Dr. Watson. Watson mentioned that the CIA have been
 * having weird problems with their supercomputer ‘The Beast’ recently.
 * This afternoon, Sherlock received a note from Moriarty, saying he has
 * infected ‘The Beast’ with a virus. In addition the note had the number ‘N’
 * printed on it. After doing some calculations, Sherlock found out that the key
 * to remove the virus is the largest ‘Decent’ Number having ‘N’ digits.
 * A ‘Decent’ Number has -
 * 1. Only 3 and 5 as its digits.
 * 2. Number of times 3 appears is divisible by 5.
 * 3. Number of times 5 appears is divisible by 3.
 * Meanwhile, the counter to destruction of ‘The Beast’ is running very fast.
 * Can you save ‘The Beast’ and find the key before Sherlock?
 * Input Format
 * 1st line will contain an integer T, the number of test cases, followed by T
 * lines, each line containing an integer N i.e. the number of digits in the
 * number
 * Output Format
 * Largest Decent number having N digits. If no such number exists, you tell
 * Sherlock that he is wrong and print ‘-1’
 * Constraints
 * 1<=T<=20
 * 1<=N<=100000
 * Sample Input
 * 4
 * 1
 * 3
 * 5
 * 11
 * Sample Output
 * -1
 * 555
 * 33333
 * 55555533333
 * Explanation
 * For N=1 , there is no such number.
 * for N=3, 555 is only possible number.
 * For N=5, 33333 is only possible number.
 * For N=11 , 55555533333 and all of permutations of digits are valid numbers,
 * among them, the given number is the largest one.
