/**
 * Problem Statement
 * 
 * Roy wanted to increase his typing speed for programming contests. So, his
 * friend advised him to type the sentence
 * "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" repeatedly because it is a
 * pangram. ( pangrams are sentences constructed by using every letter of the
 * alphabet at least once. )
 * 
 * After typing the sentence several times, Roy became bored with it. So he
 * started to look for other pangrams.
 * 
 * Given a sentence s, tell Roy if it is a pangram or not.
 * 
 * Input Format
 * 
 * Input consists of a line containing s.
 * 
 * Constraints Length of s can be atmost 103 (1≤|s|≤103) and it may contain
 * spaces, lowercase and uppercase letters. Lowercase and uppercase instances of
 * a letter are considered same.
 * 
 * Output Format
 * 
 * Output a line containing pangram if s is a pangram, otherwise output not
 * pangram.
 * 
 * Sample Input #1
 * 
 * We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the next prize Sample Output #1
 * 
 * pangram Sample Input #2
 * 
 * We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the prize Sample Output #2
 * 
 * not pangram Explanation
 * 
 * In the first testcase, the answer is pangram because the sentence contains
 * all the letters.
