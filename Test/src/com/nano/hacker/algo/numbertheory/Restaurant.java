/**
 * Problem Statement
 * 
 * Martha is interviewing at Subway. One of the rounds of the interview requires
 * her to cut a bread of size l×b into smaller identical pieces such that each
 * piece is a square having maximum possible side length with no left over piece
 * of bread.
 * 
 * Input format The first line contains an integer T. T lines follow. Each line
 * contains two space separated integers l and b which denote length and breadth
 * of the bread.
 * 
 * Output format
 * 
 * T lines, each containing an integer that denotes the number of squares of
 * maximum size, when the bread is cut as per the given condition.
 * 
 * Constraints
 * 
 * 1 <= T <= 1000 1 <= l, b <= 1000 Sample Input
 * 
 * 2 2 2 6 9 Sample Output
 * 
 * 1 6 Explanation
 * 
 * The 1st testcase has a bread whose original dimensions are 2×2, the bread is
 * uncut and is a square. Hence the answer is 1. The 2nd testcase has a bread of
 * size 6×9. We can cut it into 54 squares of size 1×1, 0 of size 2×2, 6 of size
 * 3×3, 0 of size 4×4, 0 of size 5×5 and 0 of size 6×6. The number of squares of
 * maximum size that can be cut is 6.
