 * @author LXMRX Problem Statement
 * 
 *         Gandalf is travelling from Rohan to Rivendell to meet Frodo but there
 *         is no direct route from Rohan (T1) to Rivendell (Tn).
 * 
 *         But there are towns T2,T3,T4...Tn-1 such that there are N1 routes
 *         from Town T1 to T2, and in general, Ni routes from Ti to Ti+1 for i=1
 *         to n-1 and 0 routes for any other Ti to Tj for j â‰  i+1
 * 
 *         Find the total number of routes Gandalf can take to reach Rivendell
 *         from Rohan.
 * 
 *         Note Gandalf has to pass all the towns Ti for i=1 to n-1 in numerical
 *         order to reach Tn. For each Ti , Ti+1 there are only Ni distinct
 *         routes Gandalf can take.
 * 
 *         Input Format The first line contains an integer T, T test-cases
 *         follow. Each test-case has 2 lines. The first line contains an
 *         integer N (the number of towns). The second line contains N - 1 space
 *         separated integers where the ith integer denotes the number of
 *         routes, Ni, from the town Ti to Ti+1
 * 
 *         Output Format Total number of routes from T1 to Tn modulo 1234567
 * 
 *         Constraints 1 <= T<=1000 2< N <=100 1 <= Ni <=1000
 * 
 *         Sample Input
 * 
 *         2 3 1 3 4 2 2 2 Sample Output
 * 
 *         3 8 Explanation Case 1: 1 route from T1 to T2, 3 routes from T2 to
 *         T3, hence only 3 routes. Case 2: There are 2 routes from each city to
 *         the next, at each city, Gandalf has 2 choices to make, hence 2 * 2 *
 *         2 = 8.
